A* Path Planning 

A* is one of the best path planning algorithms. It derives from Dijkstra algorithm. In addition, A* algorithm uses the heuristic cost to find the shortest path between two point, therefore it is faster than Dijkstra. In this repository, A* path finding algorithm has been demonstrated. 

In order to run the program, navigate the directory after cloning or downloading and run the main.py

The program depends on Pygame external library. 

First click will marked the cell as start point(orange), second is target point(turquise). After determining start and end nodes, clicking other empty(white) cells makes them obstacle and they will be turned black. After pressing space the algortihm starts and when the end point is in closed list, it will  marked the shortest path as purple.
